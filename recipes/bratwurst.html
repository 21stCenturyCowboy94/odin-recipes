    <h2>The Bratwurst with Sauerkraut on a Bun is a tradtitional food from Germany!</h2>
    <p>The Bratwurst is a meat sausage that was invented in Bavaria, Germany.
        It is often served with a layer of sauerkraut, and sometimes its served in a hot dog bun with sauerkraut
        and traditional German Mustard.</p>
    </br>
    <p>The bratwurst is very popular outside of Germany, especially in countries like the United States,
        where a lot of Germans immigrate to over the centuries. Bratwurst can be found in grocery stores in the USA
        and other countries, and its often a staple meal at events like "Oktoberfest," which is a German holiday
        that's celebrated every fall in Germany and around the world.
