    </div>
    <div class="p2">
    <p>Spaghetti is a traditional noodle-dish from Italy. Spaghetti noodles are made with wheat or other grains
        and are often served with sauce and other items on top. In this recipe, we will add tomato sauce to the top</p>
    </br>
    <p>Spaghetti is eaten all over the world due to mass emigration from Italy to other countries around the world.
        Many stores in the USA sell Spaghetti noodles that you can cook, and many people in the USA eat Spaghetti very
        often.

        <ol>
            <li>You need a pot; fill the pot with water and put it on a stove top, set the stover heat to high, and wait

                Cook
                the basil leave in the olive oil.</li>
            <li>While the Spaghetti and basil leaves cook, pour tomato sauce into another non-stick pan, and cook in

            <li>When ready, take the tomato sauce andf pour it on top of the spaghetti noodles on the serving plate.
